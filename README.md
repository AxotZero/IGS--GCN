## Introduction
The model architecture is referenced from Microsoft CVPR2020 paper ‚ÄúSemantics-Guided Neural Networks for Efficient Skeleton-Based Human Action Recognition‚Äù.

Referencing this paper to try to use gcn in any general cases.


## Data
Data are the assets of IGS which is private.

They are 2D data which columns represent each features and rows represent behavior at some time.


## Model Overview and architecture


The whole model architectur can be splited to Feature-Level-Module and Time-Level-Module

- Feature-Level-Module is to get feature map from single row.
- Time-Level-Module it to combine and get infromation from all feature maps.

## Conclusion
As you can see, the test accuracy from Notebook that we get is 0.92ü•∞.
I can't say that this method is effective for all cases , but I speculate that most of the data forms should be applicable.
